"My name is Corey Dooley and I consider myself the Blueprint Model for Youth to Emulate. 

In 2013 my family and I were impacted by a traumatic event. We were ambushed in my grandmother's garage by my then stepfather which resulted in me being shot 4 times. 

Doctors gave me less than a 1% chance to survive. 

Since overcoming this obstacle, I have earned multiple degrees, become a mentor, help develop a commercial corridor, published an autobiography, and now I am running to become the youngest alderman in City Council!

Now more than ever our bevloved City of Chicago has the opportunity to invest in our future by involving in our youth.

It is vital that we give our youth opportunities to get involved in Civic Engagement, Entrepreneurship, Public Safety and most importantly give us the opportunity to lead.

Trust us to guide the next generations to the Promised Land." - Corey Dooley

"Commonly when developing communities there are three main avenues taken; these efforts primarily consist of social development, political development and economical development. Social changes may look like food drives while political changes may look like voter registration events. While both of these efforts are completely neccessary for the well being of the community, we must not forget to pair these initiatives with economic development, such as the flourishment of our busineses and commercial corridors. Roosevelt Road, Madison Street, Chicago Avenue, Division, North Avenue, and Harlem Avenue are the Windows to our Ward and will serve as so." - Corey Dooley

"By electing the youngest Alderman to the City Council, we have the possibility to shift the public image of youth from Criminalizer to Capitalizer. We need to humanize youth, not demonize youth. Pathologically, if we see youth as violent or as a threat then it justifies the inhumane social, political, and economical behavior towards us. Furthermore, hindering our ability to receive social justice and silencing our cry for basic opportunities. In the 29th Ward, I will truly serve justice and effectively mobilize youth, by properly addressing human rights issues such as the economic inequalities that exist in our ward." - Corey Dooley (Arizona State Writing)

`AUSTIN — Two community activists are trying to unseat a West Side alderman.

Ald. Chris Taliaferro is seeking a third term as the 29th Ward alderman after an unsuccessful bid for a Cook County judge post in June. He faces challenges from CB Johnson, a veteran community organizer, and 25-year-old Corey Dooley.

The 29th Ward covers parts of Austin, Belmont Cragin, Galewood, Dunning and Montclare.

The election is Feb. 28. If no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, the top two will go to a runoff April 4.` - https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/01/23/ald-chris-taliaferro-faces-2-community-activists-in-29th-ward-race-on-west-side/

`RIVER FOREST, ILL. — Growing up, Corey Dooley (Dallas, TX) had dreams and aspirations of being a big time college football player and eventually, a National Football League (NFL) star. But for Dooley, a lot of that came to an end when he was shot four times in his Dallas garage, forever changing his life. Now a graduate of Concordia University Chicago (CUC), Dooley is looking to run for 29th Ward Alderman and become the youngest member on the Chicago City Council. 

"My dream was to be an All-American, go to the University of Texas, and eventually get drafted into the NFL." Dooley states, "[I was] shot four times and my mother twice, all while my brother witnessed from the backseat. Doctors gave me less than a 1% chance to live." After Dooley healed from his injuries, he graduated from South Grand Prairie High School and came to CUC to play on the football team as a wide receiver.
 
In his time as a Cougar, Dooley excelled and helped the CUC football team to many victories. During his career, he amounted to 1209 all-purpose yards, 83 receptions, and four touchdowns. His largest single game high came on October 6th, 2018 against Aurora, where he completed 123 reception yards.

 "The good part is, I was taught to work collectively in a team setting, it kept me in excellent physical shape, I built long-term relationships, and I learned to balance my life (school, work, social life, etc.)." Dooley explains how being a student athlete affected his professional career, "The not so good part is after football I found it hard to navigate a life without sports. When I played football, my schedule was always set for me. I was always told where to go, what to eat, when to workout and how to study. I didn't have to find my purpose because the coach told me my purpose. I didn't have to find my identity because my identity was being a student-athlete. After sports I had to find my own purpose and my own identity."

When asked about his advice to young student athletes looking to use their leadership skills, Dooley had this to say: "Create a diverse network by building and keeping relationships with the people around you and the people you meet. In life it is not about what you know, but who you know, show me your network and I will show you your net-worth, you are an average of the 5 people you hang around the most." This advice is what brought Dooley from student athlete to political candidate.

Dooley has now submitted petitions to the Chicago Board of Elections to qualify for the ballot in February. His campaign is focused on improving the lives of the 29th Ward residents and creating a more people-powered community.
